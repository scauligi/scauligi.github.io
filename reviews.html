    <h2>What do people think of my research?</h2>
    <p>
      This is <span class="emph">unacceptable at a reputable conference.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The key weakness of the paper is that it is <span class="emph">underwhelming</span> and thus a weak candidate.
    </p>
    <p>
      While I think you described and executed your ideas well,
      <span class="emph">I don't think this is a worthwhile research direction.</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="emph">I have rarely been so disappointed by a paper.</span>
      What a great topic, what a great abstract and introduction, and then
      <span class="emph">what a letdown.</span>
      I totally agree that this is very worthwhile work, but the paper that was delivered
      <span class="emph">falls flat on its face</span>
      and doesn't deliver on its promise.
